            <h2 class="subtitle">Overview of Cameroon</h2>
            <p>Cameroon is a country located in Central Africa, just above the equator. It covers an area of
                approximately
                475,000 square kilometers
                and has an estimated population of around 30 million people. Often referred to as "Africa in miniature,"
                Cameroon boasts a remarkable cultural
                and geographical diversity that mirrors the continent as a whole. It is home to over 250 ethnic groups
                and
                languages, which contribute to its rich and vibrant cultural mosaic.
                <br>
                Geographically, the country spans four distinct regions: the coastal plains in the southwest, the
                mountainous highlands in the west,
                the forested southern plateau, and the northern savannahs. Mount Cameroon, an active volcano near the
                Gulf
                of Guinea, is the highest peak in West and Central Africa,
                rising to over 4,000 meters. The country's diverse ecosystems range from tropical rainforests to arid
                Sahelian zones, supporting a wide array of flora and fauna.
                <br>
                Cameroon is one of only two countries in the world with both French and English as official languages, a
                legacy of its colonial history
                under both French and British administration following Germany's defeat in World War I. This
                bilingualism is
                reflected in its legal and educational systems,
                and it plays a central role in the nation's identity and political landscape.
                <br>
                The economy of Cameroon is diverse, with key sectors including agriculture, oil and gas, mining, and
                services.
                The country is a leading producer of cocoa, coffee, cotton, and bananas, and its cultural festivals,
                music,
                and cuisine are celebrated across the region for their richness and variety.
                <br>
                Despite its natural wealth and cultural assets, Cameroon faces challenges related to governance,
                economic
                inequality, and regional tensions,
                particularly between its Anglophone and Francophone regions. Nevertheless, it remains a vital and
                influential nation within the Central African sub-region
                and continues to play a key role in regional integration and stability.
